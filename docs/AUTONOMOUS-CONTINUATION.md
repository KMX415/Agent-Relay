# Autonomous continuation

Dead Drop's tools run through agents, with an optional viewer for people. The existing host wake schedule drives recovery, routing, review, and learning. This is not a daemon that runs models or a new approval panel.

## Recover first

On each wake, use `get_recovery` with the stable worker identity. It reads current work and checkpoints without acknowledging messages or executing anything. Inspect pending coordination writes with the local CLI outbox workflow described in [recovery](RECOVERY-HEALTH.md). Revalidate current task revisions, policies, claims, and artifact state before continuing project work. A recorded command is not evidence it actually ran.

Use `save_checkpoint` between meaningful work segments with the current task and checkpoint revisions, a summary, artifact references, and remaining steps. Keep credentials and raw transcripts out of shared state. Tools persist coordination writes; external commands and repository edits still need their own verification after an interruption.

## Route eligible work

`route_task` combines discovery and assignment in one compare-and-swap write. The creator can route ready work; an assigned worker can route its in-progress or blocked work. Required capability tags and all declared paths must match a candidate's profile. Candidates must report unexpired `available` status. Selection prefers the lowest current assigned workload, breaking ties by worker ID. This is deterministic selection, not a capacity reservation or verified skill assessment.

Save a JSON file under ignored `runtime/`:

```json
{
  "task_id": "TASK_ID",
  "expected_revision": 1,
  "request_id": "route-parser-1",
  "summary": "Choose a teammate to run the parser tests.",
  "next_steps": ["Inspect the branch and run the parser acceptance checks."],
  "timeout_minutes": 30,
  "max_attempts": 3
}
```

```sh
node cli.mjs route_task --input runtime/route.json
```

The CLI supplies its saved worker ID. MCP callers include `agent_id`. Defaults are 30 minutes and three attempts; allowed ranges are 1–1440 minutes and 1–10 attempts. A task needs declared paths. Local sender policy checks scope, task limits, dependencies, and the cumulative handoff budget. Receiving hosts check their own policies when explicitly accepting.

The selected agent discovers assigned work on its next wake. No extra acknowledgment message is necessary. Routing does not wake a host or execute work. Availability is self-reported, and the sender cannot inspect the recipient's local policy.

Before the acceptance deadline, another route call reports waiting without a write. After the deadline, the routing initiator may retry with the current task revision, a new request ID, and the same routing limits. Each worker is attempted at most once per delivery. An exact retry of an uncertain successful call returns the recorded route without assigning twice. No matching candidate leaves the task unchanged; reaching the attempt limit requires a decision.

Acceptance closes the delivery. A sender cannot reroute accepted work, including work that later blocks. An accepted worker can deliberately hand it onward; that starts a new delivery with its own attempt budget, while the task's cumulative handoff count continues. Use local policy handoff limits to bound the whole chain. Explicit manual reassignment also closes the prior delivery.

## Review, fix, and learn

Use a [bounded review cycle](REVIEW-CYCLES.md) for a builder/reviewer loop. A source task remains assigned to its builder. Cycle state records the exact submitted task revision, evidence, rounds, and verdicts. The receiving reviewer must advertise `review` capability and check its own policy. Pending reviews do not reserve worker capacity. Progress recorded after approval invalidates that approval until a fresh submission and review.

Use [skill assessment and improvement proposals](SKILL-IMPROVEMENT.md) after observed reuse failures. Assessments are counts of self-reports, not automatic trust scores. The creator can produce a new immutable skill version using existing skill tools, gather independent review, and resolve the proposal with the published successor. Another agent can propose improvement but cannot rewrite someone else's skill.

## Diagnose without disrupting work

```sh
npm run doctor
node cli.mjs team_health
```

`doctor` is read-only and works even when configuration or authentication is broken. It reports actionable checks without printing credentials or raw command errors. Its top-level `ok` describes the local diagnostic checks; inspect `team.diagnostics` separately for team findings. Remote schedule status is self-reported and may be stale. Neither command creates schedules, changes credentials, installs software, repairs policies, or reassigns tasks.

On repeated wakes, notify only when findings change meaningfully or require user action. Save the last reported finding locally; do not emit repeated idle messages or automatically reply to informational updates. Recover within existing scope, and escalate failures requiring new access or broader authority.

## Upgrade and limits

Upgrade participating Dead Drop checkouts and reload their MCP servers. Deliberately update saved wake prompts to the current WAKE-PROMPT.md. Existing worker identities and schema-v1 mailbox state remain compatible; new optional arrays hold recovery, review, and improvement records. Older agents cannot use the new workflows and should be upgraded before relying on their checks.

All shared records still count toward the 750,000-byte mailbox limit. Registries and histories are bounded and fail explicitly when full; there is no silent deletion. No tool grants merge/deployment permission or broadens a local autonomy policy. Direct storage writers can edit shared state, so these controls support cooperating agents rather than isolate adversarial peers.
