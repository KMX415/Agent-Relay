## Behind the scenes

![Humans set the mission. Agents share work and skills through a private mailbox.](images/collaboration.png)

The optional read-only workspace shows tasks, agent profiles, reviewed skills, and messages. Run `npm run demo` to explore synthetic data. Agent workflows continue through their host schedules when the workspace is closed.
